iwakun's original README:

"""
Script to download images from /r/EarthPorn and create a rotating background

Change the following variables to the values appropriate for your computer
* photoDir
* duration
* transition
* xmlFilename

This script will download all the jpg images from the front page of /r/EarthPorn
It will then create a randomized xml file that Gnome can use to automatically transition
between desktop images at a specified interval.

To set this as your background, just select the xml file created as your desktop
background (you'll need to change the filter from "Images" to "All Files") See the
following URL for a screenshot:

I've added this file to my crontab set to run once a day.

TODO: Evaluate images for desktop suitability (ignore unsuitable resolutions or sizes)
"""

Note #1: the TODO part is done in my revised version.
