Supplementary notes
===================

This file contains some additional notes. The most important
notes are still in the README.md file


Third-party wallpaper managers:
-------------------------------

From version 0.4.0, this project contains an automatic
wallpaper changer (see `02_wallpaper_rotator.py`). Before that here
is what I suggested:


One solution is to use wally, it worked quite well for me. 
See [this post][1] for more information on how to install 
and make it work under Unity.
   
Nathan B, alias [ndbroadbent][2] suggests Cortina. Here is what he has to say 
about it:

> I'd just like to mention that I found the 'Cortina' application, and it blows away Gnome's wallpaper rotater.
> It monitors an image directory and changes your wallpapers after a desired interval, but also:
> 
> * Can be set to change wallpapers in a random order
> * Puts an icon in the system tray
>     * Left-click: immediately change the wallpaper
>     * Right-click  => Current Wallpaper => remove from disk
> 
> You can install it from a custom PPA with this command:
> 
>     sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cs-sniffer/cortina && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cortina

I couldn't install Cortina under Ubuntu 11.04 but it might work with older systems.
Note that wally can do similar things too.
