This free software is copyleft licensed under the same terms as Python, or,
at your option, under version 2 of the GPL license.

(The original script was written by reddit user iwakun. He announced his script
at http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/gghyx/python_script_to_download_images_from_rearthporn/ .
You can also find his script in the original-by-iwakun/ folder).

The goal of the script is to download images from a reddit category and 
create an XML file that can be set as background in Gnome. The XML file
will rotate the images in a circular way.

Here is the list of changes that I added to the original version:
* You can choose from several reddit categories. You can also 
  specify your favorite category.
* Screen scraping is done with the BeautifulSoup library.
* The most important change is the filtering of images that are
  unsuitable as wallpapers, i.e. small images, portrait images, and
  images with strange ratio are removed from the list.
* XML writing is done with the lxml library.
* Support for Flickr images (zioyero's patch).

For installing lxml, please refer to the entry https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/write-xml-to-file/,
where the installation procedure is explained at the end of the post.

Finally, I would like to quote the original README of iwakun:

"Script to download images from /r/EarthPorn and create a rotating background

Change the following variables to the values appropriate for your computer
* photoDir
* duration
* transition
* xmlFilename

This script will download all the jpg images from the front page of /r/EarthPorn
It will then create a randomized xml file that Gnome can use to automatically transition
between desktop images at a specified interval.

To set this as your background, just select the xml file created as your desktop
background (you'll need to change the filter from "Images" to "All Files") See the
following URL for a screenshot:

I've added this file to my crontab set to run once a day.

TODO: Evaluate images for desktop suitability (ignore unsuitable resolutions or sizes)"

Note #1: the TODO part is done in my revised version.

Note #2: To set the background XML from the command-line, use this command:
gconftool-2 --type string --set /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename /absolute_path_to/EarthPorn.xml
